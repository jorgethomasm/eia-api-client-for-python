# eia-api-client-for-python
A blazing fast client / connector to *extract* and *analyse* data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API.

Just: 
1. Get you API key here: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php
2. Copy and save it as an environment variable with the title EIA_API_KEY
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the scripts in the examples folders, modify and experiment with the blazing **fast power** of *DuckDB* and *Polars* for data manipulation and analysis!

I tried to be as minimalistic as possible with the dependencies, so you can easily install the requirements and start using the client.
